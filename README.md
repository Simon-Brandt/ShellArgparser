# Shell Argparser

The Argparser is designed to be an easy-to-use, yet powerful command-line argument parser for your shell scripts. It is mainly targeting Bash, but other shells are supported, as well.

Applying the Argparser should lead to shorter and more concise code than the traditional [`getopt`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getopt.1.html "man7.org &rightarrow; man pages &rightarrow; getopt(1)") and [`getopts`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#index-getopts "gnu.org &rightarrow; Bourne Shell Builtins &rightarrow; getopts") allow. More importantly, the user-friendliness of Argparser-powered command-line parsing is far superior thanks to a wide range of checked conditions with meaningful error messages. The Argparser is inspired by the Python [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html "python.org &rightarrow; Python documentation &rightarrow; argparse module") module.

## 1. Features

- Parsing of positional and keyword (option) arguments
- Any number of short and long option names for the same option (as aliases)
- Default and choice values, type checking, deprecation note
- Error and warning messages for wrongly or not set arguments
- Assignment of arguments' values to corresponding script variables
- Automatic creation of help, usage, and version message
- Full internationalization / localization support
- Inheritable arguments definition across multiple scripts
- Large configurability by environment variables and companion files to your script

## 2. Quick start

No installation of the Argparser is necessary, just clone the repository and add its location to the [`PATH`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Variables.html#index-PATH "gnu.org &rightarrow; Bourne Shell Variables &rightarrow; PATH") variable. Alternatively, you may move the [Argparser executable](argparser) into a directory which is already covered by your `PATH`. All other files within the repository serve documentation and testing purposes, and you don't need to keep them.

```bash
# Switch to the installation directory of your choice, e.g., /usr/local/bin.
cd /path/to/directory

# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser.git

# Adjust the PATH.
PATH="/path/to/ShellArgparser:${PATH}"
```

A very simple quick-start script may look like this:

</details>

First, you need to define the arguments your script shall accept, in a tabular manner. Then, you [`source`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html#index-source "gnu.org &rightarrow; Bash Builtins &rightarrow; source") the Argparser with the current command line (sourcing means in-place execution without forking). Upon this, the Argparser will parse your script's command line, check the arguments for validity, set default values, and assign the values to variables in your script's environment. Many of these steps can be customized by [environment variables](docs/reference/environment_variables/overview.md). The script's remainder just prints the optional and required keyword and positional arguments, and is not a part of the Argparser invokation.

## 3. Documentation

The Argparser's extensive documentation is stored in the [docs](docs) directory, which you should consult to learn all the functionality the Argparser provides. Each file provides a chapter (section) of the documentation, and arrows on the bottom allow you to navigate through the sections, without needing to care about which file stores the requested chapter.

If you want to read the documentation end-to-end, start with the [introduction](docs/introduction.md). For searching through the entire documentation, you can open the [source file](docs/.src.md) that is used to generate the chapters, or use the main [table of contents](docs/toc.md).

## 4. Dependencies

The Argparser is a plain Bash script that does not invoke external commands (only Bash builtins) by design decision. This allows running your script on multiple platforms, as long as Bash is installed, without adding further dependencies to your script. When [contributing](#6-contributions), you may need several other software tools listed and explained in the [documentation](docs/dependencies.md).

For simply running the Argparser, only Bash is required. **Bash&nbsp;&ge;&#8239;4.4** is known to be mandatory, but testing occurred mainly on Bash&nbsp;5.2. Thus, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser/issues/new "github.com &rightarrow; Simon-Brandt &rightarrow; ShellArgparser &rightarrow; Issues") if you encounter errors for versions earlier than 5.2, such that the minimum version can be updated, here (or the bug can be fixed).

## 5. License

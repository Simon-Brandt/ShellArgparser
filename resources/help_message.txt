# Purpose: Print a help message for test_help_message.sh, invoked by
# test_help_message.sh --help.  Compared to the auto-generated help
# message by the argparse functions, this one is enriched by the
# explanation of the include directives.

# Note: Neither commented lines nor their trailing blank lines get
# printed when invoking test_help_message.sh --help, if
# ARGPARSER_HELP_FILE_KEEP_COMMENTS is set to "false".  The include
# directives get replaced by the auto-generated help message components.

# Print the header.
A brief header summarizes the way how to interpret the help message.

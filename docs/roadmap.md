## 7. Roadmap

Future Argparser versions will add several new features and address known issues. The following sections shall give an overview over them. Beforehand, we'll discuss the release policy for the Argparser.

### 7.1. Release and versioning policy

The Argparser uses [semantic versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/ "semver.org") for the releases, *i.e.*, version numbers given by major version, minor version, and patch, separated by dots. There is only one supported minor version at a time (for bugfixes) to reduce developer burden, with new versions being released in strictly monotonic succession, regarding their version numbers.

Besides the SemVer version numbers, each version is assigned a codename (because why not?). Since the Argparser evolved from a very early command-line argument parser used in an analysis pipeline for Placentalia (an infraclass of mammals, precisely, the extant Eutheria), the codenames are placental mammals' species names. The major versions determine the taxonomic order, the minor version is given by the genus, and the patch version by the species name, in alphabetic order (as far as possible, *i.e.*, as long as there are species names beginning with the respective letter). For the first major series of releases, we use rodent names. So the first Argparser release, v1.0.0, is codenamed *"[Acomys airensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Saharan_spiny_mouse "wikipedia.org &rightarrow; Western Saharan spiny mouse")"*.

The following table lists all versions released so far:

<!-- <table caption="List of Argparser releases"> -->
*Tab. 6: List of Argparser releases.*

| Version number | Codename                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| v1.1.1         | *Biswamoyopterus gaoligongensis* |
| v1.1.0         | *Biswamoyopterus biswasi*        |
| v1.0.1         | *Acomys cahirinus*               |
| v1.0.0         | *Acomys airensis*                |

You can obtain the version number of your Argparser copy by querying `argparser --version`:

<!-- <include command="argparser --version" lang="console"> -->
```console
$ argparser --version
argparser v1.1.1 "Biswamoyopterus gaoligongensis"
```
<!-- </include> -->

In the spirit of SemVer, you can then gauge the need to update to a newer Argparser version by comparing the version numbers of your copy and the latest [release](https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser/releases "github.com &rightarrow; Simon-Brandt &rightarrow; ShellArgparser &rightarrow; Releases").

Bugfixes (increment of patch version) should be released immediately once it is confirmed that they actually fix the bug, while new features are added on a longer timescale (increment of minor version). Breaking changes (increment of major version) are kept unreleased for the longest time, trying to accumulate several changes to release them altogether. However, if a pending change severely hinders the Argparser's further development, the breaking change will be released sooner.

Breaking changes in the sense of SemVer *only* apply to modifications to the code that are expected or proven to change the Argparser's behavior in a way that can be seen by your script when normally running the Argparser. That is, a breaking change may be the modification of an environment variable's default value or an alteration of the output generated when [`ARGPARSER_WRITE_ARGS`](reference/environment_variables/environment_variables.md#9462-argparser_write_args) is set to `true`. In contrast, at least for now, the Argparser's internal state is completely hidden from a normal Argparser call. While it is possible to use the functions for your own purpose (by setting [`ARGPARSER_UNSET_FUNCTIONS`](reference/environment_variables/environment_variables.md#9445-argparser_unset_functions) to `false`), any change is considered an implementation detail, as long as the Argparser's output remains unchanged. The help, usage, version, error, and warning messages are intended for human view, and not to be parsed by scripts. Consequently, their structure and contents may change at any time.

Likewise, changes to the tests, comparison scripts, and documentation are *not* considered for assessing changes as breaking and may occur at any point. In other words, SemVer only applies to the [Argparser exectutable](../argparser), while all other files are just distributed with it under the same version number.

To simplify the transition to newer Argparser versions, it is expected to have scripts in the repository that try to flag changed behavior for your script, whenever breaking changes are made. Whether it may be possible to automatically upgrade your code to comply with the new features, strongly depends on the changes' complexity and can't be judged, here.

### 7.2. Future enhancements

The following features are considered for addition in a future version. If you miss one, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser/issues/new "github.com &rightarrow; Simon-Brandt &rightarrow; ShellArgparser &rightarrow; Issues") to propose it. Note that the feature descriptions are rather open-ended collections of rough idea sketches, instead of precise milestones, so any idea may change, once a better way has been found.  Further, the implementation likelihood only means how desirable a feature seems for the Argparser, not when it will be implemented.

#### 7.2.1. Argument relations

- ***Description:*** Sometimes, multiple arguments may only be given together, or the existence of one argument mandates the existence of another one, which on itself could also be given alone. Secondly, options may contradict each other, like `--verbose` and `--quiet`, and so can only be given in an exclusive fashion on the command line. To enable this behavior, it is likely necessary to introduce another array showing the relations these arguments have. For example, some syntax like `var_a | var_b` may show contravalence (XOR) for mandatory arguments or exclusion (NAND) for optional arguments. This relation would set both arguments as mutually exclusive. Other operators, like `<-` for a prependency or `<->` for a biconditional, will need to be introduced for the aforementioned cases. However, in order to specify a minimal and clear syntax which facilitates application in scripts, and to find an optimal way of parsing, more exploratory trial work needs to be done.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** High.

#### 7.2.2. Optional help message headings

- ***Description:*** In help messages, arguments are grouped by their arguments group. Still, if there's only one argument group, there is no need to print the heading. In other cases, it may be advantageous to also print the heading for the help options, which is currently suppressed. By adding a dedicated character to the include directive, it would be possible to opt in and out of headings.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** High.

#### 7.2.3. Intermixed positional and keyword arguments

- ***Description:*** Currently, positional arguments must be delimited by a `--` from keyword arguments, and subsequent keyword arguments by a `++` from positional arguments. It may be useful to reflect the rather usual behavior of allowing truly intermixed positional and keyword arguments by distinguishing them based on the argument number an argument requires.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Medium.

#### 7.2.4. Single-hyphen long options

- ***Description:*** On certain platforms, long options may be given with only one hyphen, sometimes exclusively, sometimes as an alternative to two hyphens. Even programs like GNU [`find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html "man7.org &rightarrow; man pages &rightarrow; find(1)") act like this. However, there is a natural ambiguity whether an argument with one hyphen is a single-hyphen long option or a set of concatenated (merged) short options. Allowing single-hyphen long options would require a far more complex parsing step, when an argument with one hyphen is interpreted as long option, as long as one with this name exists, or as a set of short options, else (if allowed at all).
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Medium.

#### 7.2.5. Usage message include directives

- ***Description:*** Currently, for an [`ARGPARSER_USAGE_FILE`](reference/environment_variables/environment_variables.md#9447-argparser_usage_file), only the [`@All`](reference/include_directives.md#931-all-directive) [include directive](reference/include_directives.md#93-include-directives) is supported. Should there be demand to provide more fine-grained control, more directives could be added.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Medium.

#### 7.2.6. License note

- ***Description:*** Usually, a [version message](tutorial/version_messages.md#58-version-messages) indicates the script's license, or at least gives a note about the lack of warranty for functionality of free software. The Argparser instead only gives the script's name (the [`ARGPARSER_SCRIPT_NAME`](reference/environment_variables/environment_variables.md#9437-argparser_script_name)) and the version number (the [`ARGPARSER_VERSION_NUMBER`](reference/environment_variables/environment_variables.md#9458-argparser_version_number)). Adding the dummy text for the warranty is easy, but would mean that any script employing the Argparser would indentify itself as free software. This would also hold for the (highly discouraged) proprietary software that may use the Argparser, thus misleading the users. Therefore, some environment variable may be needed to control the addition.  
Moreover, it could be even deemed useful to add a `-l,--license` flag to the default options, which would output an `ARGPARSER_LICENSE_FILE`'s contents, showing the exact license&mdash;or just its name?
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Medium.

#### 7.2.7. Programmable argument completion

- ***Description:*** When typing long option names on the command line, without wanting or being allowed to abbreviate the names, hitting `TAB` could auto-complete the option name using programmable completion. However, the complexity and benefits of such a feature still need to be figured out.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Medium/Low.

#### 7.2.8. POSIX compliance

- ***Description:*** POSIX allows very few constructs for argument parsing, like no long options. Since there are perfectly suitable alternatives for this simple parsing, and the Argparser aims at a way more sophisticated command-line interface, opt-in POSIX compliance seems unnecessary for now.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Low.

#### 7.2.9. Alternative option prefixes (`+`/`/`)

- ***Description:*** On certain platforms, options are given with other prefixes, like `/` on DOS-like systems. The Argparser targets Unix-like platforms, and allowing other characters would require a massive change to the codebase. Further, plus signs are used as tokens for flag negation, so for using them as regular prefixes, the hyphen would take their role. More importantly, there is no such equivalent for the forward slash&mdash;a backslash would feel most natural, but would collide with the path separator on DOS-like platforms. Considering the massive efforts needed to implement this, it is unlikely to ever be done.
- ***Implementation likelihood:*** Almost zero.

### 7.3. Known bugs

*Currently none.*

## 4. Comparison of command-line parsers

Several other shell command-line parsers predate the argparser and were in part influential in its design choices. The table below aims at comparing their features or lack thereof, intended to be as comprehensive as possible. If you're missing a function, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser/issues/new "github.com &rightarrow; Simon-Brandt &rightarrow; ShellArgparser &rightarrow; Issues"), such that the function can be added. Manual argument parsing, the easiest (just most complex) method, is excluded here since in theory anything could be done, therein&mdash;it would just require a proportionate amount of work.

The [feature comparison](feature_comparison.md#41-feature-comparison) compares the various features for argument parsing, while some [example scripts](example_scripts/getopts.md#42-example-scripts) later demonstrate the usage for the different parsers.

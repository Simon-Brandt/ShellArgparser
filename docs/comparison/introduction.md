## 6. Comparison of command-line parsers

Several other shell command-line parsers predate the Argparser and were in part influential in its design choices. The [table](feature_comparison.md#61-feature-comparison) below aims at comparing their features or lack thereof, intended to be as comprehensive as possible. If you're missing a function, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Simon-Brandt/ShellArgparser/issues/new "github.com &rightarrow; Simon-Brandt &rightarrow; ShellArgparser &rightarrow; Issues"), such that the function can be added&mdash;to the table and maybe even to the Argparser.

Manual argument parsing, the most basic&mdash;and most tedious&mdash;method, is excluded here since in theory anything could be done, therein&mdash;it would just require a proportionate amount of complex work. After all, one could re-invent the Argparser or any other command-line parser, thus having every feature this parser supports, but without using it.

The [feature comparison](feature_comparison.md#61-feature-comparison) compares the various features for argument parsing, while some [example scripts](example_scripts/introduction.md#62-example-scripts) later demonstrate the usage for the different parsers in an exemplary use case. Finally, we will have a look at the [runtime](runtime_comparison.md#63-runtime-comparison) and [code length](code_length_comparison.md#64-code-length-comparison) for each example script.

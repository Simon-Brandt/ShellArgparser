## 7. Reference

The reference details the actual definitions of all [colors and styles](colors_and_styles.md#72-colors-and-styles), [include directives](include_directives.md#73-include-directives), and [environment variables](environment_variables/introduction.md#75-environment-variables). While it may be advantageous to read it once in its entirety to see all features not discussed in the [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction.md#3-tutorial), it is more designed as manual for specific questions regarding certain features.

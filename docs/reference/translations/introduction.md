### 8.4. Translations

In order to facilitate translators the translation of the Argparser-generated strings, most importantly the error and warning messages, and including the interpolated variables, they are listed here for reference, sorted by their occurence in the provided [translation.yaml](../resources/translation.yaml). Further, this should give an overview over the most likely reasons for argument parsing failures.

> [!NOTE]
> The translation keys in the simplified YAML file are subject to change, if messages are added or removed. Since missing keys only generate warnings (which can even be silenced using [`ARGPARSER_SILENCE_WARNINGS`](../environment_variables/environment_variables.md#8541-argparser_silence_warnings)), such changes are *not* considered breaking changes, and by this would *not* lead to an increase in the Argparser's major version number. However, as few modifications as possible are anticipated, and only when other breaking changes are introduced, larger refactorings should occur.

## 5. Tutorial

To give you an idea about the Argparser's application, the following sections show some scripts similar to those used for internal testing purposes, in the herein given form located in the [tutorial](../../tutorial) directory, trying to guide you through the various features.

> [!NOTE]
> For the terminology in argument parsing, refer to the Python [`optparse` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html#terminology "python.org &rightarrow; Python documentation &rightarrow; optparse module &rightarrow; terminology"). Additionally, for consistency with the positional arguments, options are herein often referred to as keyword arguments.

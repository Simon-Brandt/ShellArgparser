# Purpose: Print a help message for test_help_message.sh, invoked by
# test_help_message.sh --help.  Compared to the auto-generated help
# message by the argparse functions, this one is enriched by the
# explanation of the "@" directives.

# Note: Neither commented lines nor their trailing blank lines get
# printed when invoking test_help_message.sh --help.  The "@All"
# directive gets replaced by the auto-generated help message.

# Print the arguments from the "arguments" group.
The following arguments have no default value.
@Arguments

# Print the arguments from the "options" group.
The following arguments have a default value.
@Options

# Print the two help options.
There are always two options for the help messages.
@Help
